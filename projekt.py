"""
Test for primality.

This file consists of two methods for determination of primality

First is ''primes_sieve()''
Deterministic method of finding a prime number.
Method is more is more suited for creating list of primes.

Second function ''is_prime''
also deterministic function
is designed for faster operation when searching for primality of given number.
